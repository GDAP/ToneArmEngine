# Requirements
- Visual Studio 2012 is needed in order to build the projects.

- Game assets can be downloaded from these links:
	https://www.dropbox.com/s/j5kajjkntz18rbl/ToneArmEgine_AudioFiles.zip?dl=0
	https://www.dropbox.com/s/2vlradysy35uagd/ToneArmEngine_Assets.zip?dl=0
Both must be unzipped and put next to either the executable file or project files(to be able to run the game from Visual Studio)
